 SELECT * FROM Books;

SELECT * FROM Books WHERE PublicationYear > 2000;

SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Author = 'J.K. Rowling';

UPDATE Books SET Price = 13.99 WHERE Title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird';

DELETE FROM Books WHERE Title = 'The Catcher in the Rye';

This SQLite database assignment provided valuable hands-on experience in working with relational databases. I learned how to create a database, design a table with specific columns and data types, and perform various SQL operations such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. One of the key challenges I faced was setting up the SQLite environment. However, overcoming this challenge helped me better understand the process in order to complete the assignment. I found the process of querying the database particularly interesting, as it demonstrated how powerful SQL can be in extracting specific information from a dataset. This assignment has given me a solid foundation in database management and SQL, skills that I believe will be valuable in future programming and data analysis tasks.
